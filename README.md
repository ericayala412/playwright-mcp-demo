# Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use Playwright with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for automated testing. MCP enables AI-driven test automation by allowing models to interact with web applications through a standardized protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- VS Code Insiders

## Installing VS Code Insiders

1. Download VS Code Insiders:
   - For latest stable build: [https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)

2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system if downloading manually:
   - Windows: Run the downloaded installer
   - macOS: Drag the downloaded app to your Applications folder
   - Linux: Follow the package installation instructions for your distribution

3. Important: VS Code Insiders must be your default editor for the MCP extension to work properly. You can set this by:
   - Opening VS Code Insiders
   - Press Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "Shell Command: Install 'code-insiders' command in PATH"
   - Select the option to install it

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ericayala412/playwright-mcp-demo.git
   cd playwright-mcp-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To run a specific test:
```bash
npx playwright test src/test/add-shirt.spec.ts
```

## Project Structure

- `src/test/` - Contains all test files
- `src/test/config/` - Test configuration files
- `prompts/` - Example MCP prompts for test scenarios

## Test Examples

This demo includes example tests that showcase MCP capabilities:
- A test created entirely with Playwright MCP that uses a test e-commerce site to add a shirt into a shopping cart: `add-shirt.spec.ts`
- Two other prompts to try out under the `prompts` folder

## Creating Tests with Copilot and Playwright MCP

### Starting the MCP Server in VS Code Insiders

1. Open VS Code Insiders
2. Start the server:
   - Press Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "MCP: List Servers"
   - In the menu click Playwright
   - Click "Start Server"
3. Verify the server is running:
   - Repeat step 2 to list the MCP servers
   - Next to playwright you should see "running"

### Creating Tests With Copilot Chat

Once the server is running, you can create tests using the following steps:

1. Open Copilot:
   - Press Cmd+Shift+I (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) to open Copilot

2. Switch to Agent Mode:
   - Look for the chevron with the list of modes in the Copilot chat
   - Select "Agent"

3. View the full list of MCP Commands:
   - Click the wrench icon (ðŸ”§) in the chat interface
   - Scroll down to see the full list of available MCP commands you can use in your tests within the chat

Now you can start creating tests by describing what you want to test to the Agent, and it will help you implement the test using MCP commands.
